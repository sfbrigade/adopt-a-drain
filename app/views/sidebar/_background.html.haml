          Introduction
        %p
          The Adopt a Drain Durham program enables Bull City Citizens to
          "adopt" one of the city's storm drains or catch basins and
          pledge to keep it free of leaves and debris. The program helps reduce
          localized flooding and fosters community engagement by encouraging
          the public to take an active role in improving their neighborhood.

          -# In late 2015 several San Francisco City agencies partnered with
          -# volunteers from Code for San Francisco to develop the Adopt a Drain
          -# SF web application.

          -# The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), the agency
          -# that manages the sewer system, including 25,000+ catch basins and
          -# storm drains, and San Francisco Public Works, the agency that
          -# maintains the database of sewer infrastructure assets, worked with
          -# the City's Open Data Program in the Mayor's Office to get the catch
          -# basin location data uploaded to the <a
          -# href="https://data.sfgov.org">City's Open Data Portal</a> (SF Open
          -# Data).

          Code for Durham and other volunteers used a web-based
          platform called <a
          href="https://github.com/codefordurham/adopt-a-drain">Github</a> to
          develop the open source web application on <a
          href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. Github enabled
          contributors to work on the project from anywhere in the world.  They
          modeled Adopt a Drain Durham on Boston's <a
          href="http://www.adoptahydrant.org/">Adopt a Hydrant</a>, for which
          Code for America provided initial development support in 2012.

          -# SFPUC staff got internal buy-in and support for the program, created
          -# the graphics for the icons and logo, wrote the copy for the website
          -# and emails, reviewed the website for disability access, secured
          -# funding to host the site, coordinated with other SF city agencies and
          -# the City of Oakland, and promoted the program on social media,
          -# traditional media, TV advertising and various other channels. SF Open
          -# Data staff initially paid for the site to be hosted and provided
          -# ongoing strategic and technical support. Approximately 25 people
          -# contributed to coding and developing the app.
