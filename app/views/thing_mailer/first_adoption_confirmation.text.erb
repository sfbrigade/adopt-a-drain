Hi <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You just adopted one of San Francisco's 25,000 catch basins or storm drains.
Congratulations and thank you for helping to protect the environment, manage
stormwater, and minimize flooding.

How to keep your drain healthy:

1. If possible, clear the drain BEFORE it starts raining.
2. Put leaves and other natural material in your green compost bin.
3. Put trash and debris in your black garbage bin.
4. Clear about 10 feet on both sides of the drain.

Safety tips:

1. Never try to lift the drain grate... it's really heavy and you might hurt yourself!
2. Clear from the sidewalk and wear reflective clothing so cars can see you.
3. Wear gloves and use a rake, shovel, or broom and dustpan.
4. Woah! Medical waste? Needles? Other toxic material? If it's an immediate
   problem, call 9-1-1. If not, visit http://www.sf311.org/index.aspx?page=298
   to report it to 311.

What if...

* My drain is too dirty or hard to clear!
  * Contact 311 to have it cleared by the City (or dial 3-1-1)
* My drain is already flooded!
  * Contact 311 to have it cleared by the City (Dial 3-1-1 if you like)
* There's some other problem with my drain.
* Contact 311 to have it cleared by the City.

Basic legal stuff:

Remember, the City and County of San Francisco won't be held responsible for
anything that happens to you or others in service of maintaining your drain.
Please be careful!
