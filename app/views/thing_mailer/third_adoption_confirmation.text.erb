Hey <%= @user.name.split.first %>!

You're clearly awesome since you've adopted 3 drains now! Wow!

We won't write you any more emails confirming your drain adoptions since it's
rude to clog email inboxes.

Perhaps you'd be ok taking a 2-question survey for us to tell us why you
decided to adopt? Visit http://goo.gl/forms/sD3lniSd4b to participate.

Extra excited? Send a tweet to help us spread the word:

  Did you know you could "adopt" part of the #BullCity?
  http://adoptadrain.sfwater.org/ @SFWater makes it happen. #civicduty
  > #juryduty #DurhamSewers

As always, write us with suggestions, comments, photos, or complaints! We love to hear from you.

Your SFPUC
